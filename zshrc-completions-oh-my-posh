 code The script you provided is a Zsh completion script for `oh-my-posh`. This script is designed to be sourced in your `.zshrc` file to enable command-line completion for `oh-my-posh`.

To enable this script, you need to ensure that it is sourced in your `.zshrc` file. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Save the script to a file:**
   Save the provided script to a file, for example, `~/.oh-my-posh-completion.zsh`.

2. **Source the script in your `.zshrc` file:**
   Add a line to your `.zshrc` file to source the completion script.

   ```shell
   # Source oh-my-posh completion script
   source ~/.oh-my-posh-completion.zsh
   ```

3. **Reload your `.zshrc` file:**
   After adding the source line, reload your `.zshrc` file to apply the changes.

   ```shell
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

Here is an example of how your `.zshrc` file might look after adding the source line:

```shell
# Add Visual Studio Code to PATH
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
# Setup Zsh Completions and Enable Them
fpath=(/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions $fpath)
autoload -U compinit
compinit
# Enable Zsh Plugins
[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] && source ~/.zsh: command not found: .zshrc
